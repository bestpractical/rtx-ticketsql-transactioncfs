NAME
    RTx-TicketSQL-TransactionCFs - Adds searching of Transaction CFs to
    TicketSQL in RT

DESCRIPTION
    When installed, TicketSQL's syntax is extended to support the follow
    constructs:

        TransactionCF.{Name of your CF} = 'Foo'
        TxnCF.{Name} = 'Bar'

    All operators that can be used for ticket custom fields in TicketSQL
    ("CF.{Name}") may also be used for transaction CFs.

    Transaction CFs are also shown in the query builder. Globally applied
    fields are always shown, and per-queue fields are shown when there is an
    appropriate Queue condition already present. This mirrors the behaviour
    of ticket CFs.

    Requires RT 4.0.14 or higher.

INSTALLATION
    "perl Makefile.PL"
    "make"
    "make install"
        May need root permissions
